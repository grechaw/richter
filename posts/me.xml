        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <img src="images/harms.png"/>
        <p>Years of life have gone toward learning languages and technical things, how to play various musical instruments, digging into <a>databases</a> and maps and books and data.  I've had the privilege to work with <a>MarkLogic</a> Server for about six years now, first as a customer implementation at O'Reilly Media, and more recently working on the product itself.</p>
        <p>Technially I'm into content and data, databases of all kinds, <a>RDF</a>, <a>XML</a>, <a>XQuery</a>, and to some degree I'm a Java enthusiast.</p>
        <p>I've been raising my family in rural Sonoma County for quite some time, but I'm still getting used to the country.  I also keep a few chickens, and share the property with several dozen hummingbirds, the passing deer and fox.</p>
        <p>At this stage in life I'm a passionate <a>harmonica</a> player.  It's the ultimate geek-out instrument, and is conducive to a commuting lifestyle.</p>
